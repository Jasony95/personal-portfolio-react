        Hi! Welcome to my portfolio. I am Jason Yang. It's nice to have you here. Feel free to check out my work. I am
        looking forward to showing you most of the projects that I had finished. I've looked into web-development after graduating at Metropolitan State University. At first, I wasn't well into coding as a related task to my dream job. However, after taking my first coding class in university, I started to realize that I liked coding in general. I've learned the basics which was Python. After several classes into web development, I took an interest in that area. Throughout the projects that I had worked on was mostly in back-end development. I hoped to do full-stack development as I am familiar with CSS. I am planning to use React as the standard JavaScript framework for upcoming projects.
